I'm working on a tiny CRM-like tool for software engineers.

__________

Requirements Set:

**CSV imports**: Full IETF RFC-4180 spec compliance.

**Materialized Views**: Refreshed on the daily.

**Events**: Support for email / SMTP.

__________

Here's what I'm prioritizing:

**Doneness**: There will be 0.x releases. There will be 1.x releases. There will
probably not be 2.x releases. At some point this product will be "complete"
barring security patches.

**Data Portability**: When "complete", this tool will likely be open-sourced and
one-click deployable to multiple cloud environments.

**Composability**: I'm planning on a protocols-not-platforms approach for
third-party integrations and a platforms-not-products approach for the service
itself.

I'm mostly building this for myself to scratch my own itch, but it would be
terrific to have other people try this out. If you want to be part of the early
